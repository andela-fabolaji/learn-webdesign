# learn-webdesign
Do you have a busy work or life schedule? Will you like to learn web development by taking up daiy or weekly tasks or challenges? Then this curriculum is for you.


## Situation
Techsavvy Limited needs your help. They just took up a web design project for a client, their front-end developer is down with a cold and is currently tweeting from the hospital bed.
They would like you hop on board by replacing the developer. They know you don't have much experience with coding and have promised that the front end guy will guide you. Hopefully he does. 

Let's have a look at the project
